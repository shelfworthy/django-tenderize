*Note*

There is currently a bug in this implementation - the `tender_email` cookie is set to `"<email">` instead of `<email>`. Word on the street is change to the Tender code will allow this. (The Response.set_cookie() function stores cookie values as Python objects - so the email string is written as a Python string with quotes...)


Info
----

Tender uses tasty cookies to log your users in.
http://help.tenderapp.com/faqs/setup-installation/login-from-cookies

This app includes a view like `django.contrib.auth.views.login` that in addition to logging a user in as normal, sets the cookies required by Tender. Yum.


Installation
------------

Just place these files in a folder called `tenderize` on your python path, add `tenderize` to your installed apps, and add the following to `settings.py`:

# .yourdomain.com
TENDER_COOKIE_DOMAIN = '.mobify.me'

# get from tender
TENDER_SECRET = "???"

# your.tenderapp.com
TENDER_DOMAIN = 'support.mobify.me'

# how long the cookies will last
TENDER_COOKIE_AGE = 1209600 # (2 weeks in seconds)

Then add the following to urlpatterns in urls.py:

url(r'^login/$', 'tenderize.views.login_and_tenderize', name="login")
